    <div class="class1">
        <p>Archimedes, the father of Math. Whose mind was unmatched and whose knowledge had no bound. My memory of him never fades.
        His teachings live with me in my journal and memories.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am Mathit√≠s, a humble student of Archimedes. The most fortunate event that could ever happen to me is being born in
        the same city as this unequivocally important figure. I spent my entire youth dedicated to the servitude and lessons of
        my teacher. Once I was of appropriate age, I started my tutelage under him. I was there when he discovered most of his
        findings and when he engineered inventions that would change the way that the world worked, all the way until his
        demise.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My fellow peers would try to document his life, but all claimed that mine was the most sufficient. If anyone ever finds
        my journal entries, please make them accessible to the public, for knowledge should never be withheld. So, please
        indulge in the story of Archimedes and always remember who he was to us all.</p>
