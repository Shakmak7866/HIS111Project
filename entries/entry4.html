    <div class="class1">
        <p>If there was anything more that I could want to write about right now, it would be about how amazing the lessons have
            been. However, I can not. That is because right now, the peace of our land is currently being threatened by the
            Romans. War (The First Punic War) is currently being waged by the Romans to capture Greece, led by their commander,
            Marcellus. They threaten the peace that we currently have. Nowadays, all I hear are worries and dread from the
            people of this city. How I would give just to hear their laughter while the lessons were going on. The only thing I
            fear is losing my ability to learn. No lessons are going on right now. Archimedes has dedicated his full time to
            fulfilling the commands of the King. King Hieron II commanded Archimedes with the task of developing inventions that
            could protect us from the invasion of Roman soldiers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While we are not in active study, we try our best to aid our teacher, Archimedes, in whatever he needs. Archimedes
            contemplated for a while before he finally started writing. He started making schematics and models of what he
            intended to build. Even though his love of mathematics led to things that were more theoretical than practical, he
            made devices that were more than practical, they were extraordinary.

        <br>
        <p>There were three main devices that I believe should be mentioned. The first was the catapult. The catapults were
            capable of throwing large masses of rocks with a huge range. The second device was a claw, capable of grabbing ships
            and either turning them over or hitting other ships with a grabbed ship. The last one was by far the most genius and
            beautiful. It was a machine capable of casting rays like the sun, but rather than dispersed, it was focused on a
            single item. That said Ray was capable of burning its target. When the Romans came to attack, the full force of
            these devices was able to defend Syracuse from the invaders. They could not come close to land due to the catapult,
            and the seas were even harder with those latter two devices. Ships were drowned, men were thrown overboard, and the
            last devices made flames appear out of nowhere. Because of the inventions of Archimedes, we were able to defend our
            beloved city.</p>
