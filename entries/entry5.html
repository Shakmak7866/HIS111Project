    <div class="class1">
        <p>Peace is relatively short-term. At least that is how my time has become these past few years. After one war had
            ended, another one began, even though it had been a while. This time, Syracuse was on the Roman side. That was until
            they decided to support Carthage instead. In an attempt to get Syracuse back, Romans, led by Marcellus again,
            attempted to invade Syracuse once again. However, they forget about the devices that defeated them last time. As
            long as those devices are there, we should be safe. For now, I shall focus on my studies. Archimedes has been
            focused more so than ever. I have never seen him like this before. Even though he is becoming more in years as time
            goes on, he has never left his equations at all. I can only hope that this will not lead to anything distressful.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Two years have passed since I wrote the above text. The situation has gotten worse. Archimedes' invention did keep
            the city safe, however, the Romans stopped trying to directly attack the city and instead stopped its supplies. We
            now have no choice but to surrender to Marcellus and his army. Word had gotten out about how Archimedes was the one
            behind the inventions and he was key to defending the city. Upon hearing this, apparently, Marcellus had sent out
            his soldiers into the city to find Archimedes. Upon hearing this, I rushed to find Archimedes. I prayed that he was
            alright, however I could not find him. Until someone had found him. I rushed towards him. Only to find his body on
            the ground covered in blood. The smell of blood mixed with the smell of papyrus and ink. Everything started to feel
            dark. A deep pit of endless void filled within me upon seeing his corpse in front of me. He laid upon his papyri of
            circles and shapes filled with equations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Later on, we found out that a Roman soldier had found Archimedes, but did not know who it was. The soldier told the
            seemingly harmless old man to get up and leave his desk. Archimedes, being who he was, told the soldier “Do not
            disturb me and my circles.” Upon hearing this, the soldier killed Archimedes with the strike of his sword. A few of
            the people who heard what happened cried. A few were silent. A few students and I were able to crack a smile because
            that is who exactly Archimedes was. A man with an infatuation for math who wouldn't show any attention to war or
            being threatened. For there was no greater purpose for him than to do math. He died doing what he loved, a fate that
            most of us can only wish for. Truly Archimedes was… rather is the Father of Math.

        <p>Upon his grave, we went ahead and fulfilled his wish of having what he deemed to be his greatest discovery, carved on
            it. I stood in front of his grave looking at that sphere and cylinder, and I reminded myself that even though
            Archimedes is not here with us anymore, his teaching will shape the future. The only thing that I can do is try my
            best to teach the people beyond me about the man who is Archimedes. The man who defended his city and changed the
            world for the better. Archimedes, The Father of Math.
