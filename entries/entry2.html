    <div class="class1">
        <p>Eureka! I believe it to be a funny word. I'll write about it and why I think it's funny later. However, I want this to
        be on my mind while I write what I have done so far. I have been learning so much ever since I started studying under
        Archimedes. Every single time I sit with him, I feel like I learn a little bit more about how everything works. I must
        say there is no better feeling than the environment in which to learn. The voice of the teacher, writing on papyrus,
        solving equations, and so much more. It truly is a wonderful experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, it is best to practice proper healthcare as well for oneself. Unfortunately, Archimedes' dedication due math
        led to his lack of personal care and hygiene. He would often forget to eat, drink, or bathe. This reminds me of a story
        that occurred one time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There was one time when King Hieron II commanded a blacksmith to create crowns for statues and supplied the blacksmith
        with gold to make them. Later on, the king would get the crowns back but felt that something was off with them. He was
        not sure if the crowns were truly made of gold, or if the blacksmith made it with gold covering and kept the rest for
        himself. So the king tasked Archimedes with the task of finding out whether it was truly made out of gold or not without
        bringing harm to the crown.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The problem perplexed Archimedes to such an extent that he stopped eating and drinking. He started to give off a pungent
        smell due to not taking a bath. It became truly hindering to such a point that a few students and I had to force
        Archimedes to take a bath. We left Archimedes to himself and only a few minutes later, we heard him shouting. He ran out
        of the bath and onto the street, barely covering himself, and shouting “Eureka, I've got it!'' He went to the king and
        the next day, the blacksmith was executed. When asked what had occurred, Archimedes told us what happened after he sat
        in the bath. When the water had already occupied the bath, and he sat in it, the water level rose. Realizing this, he
        jumped out of the bath and went to the king to show what he had discovered. After putting some clothes on, Archimedes
        placed a piece of gold the same weight as the crown into a vessel of water and then proceeded to do the same with the
        crown. When observed, the water displacement was different, leading to show that the crown was indeed composed of metal
        other than gold due to gold having a higher density than other metals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon hearing this story, we all were amazed by the genius of Archimedes. Later on, Archimedes made further discoveries
        of this concept that we now know as buoyancy. We would call what happened in this story the Archimedes Principle. This
        led to boats of massive size being able to be afloat in water, helped Archimedes with his work named “On Floating
        Bodies,” and future intellectuals being able to use this principle to make discoveries. All of this is good, just
        because he took a bath.</p>
