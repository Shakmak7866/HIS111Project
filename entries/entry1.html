    <div class="class1">
        <p>It is a beautiful day today. The sunshine on my skin, the breeze of the sea, and the sound of laughter all around. Today
        in particular is a special day. Today is the day that I finally became a student of the father of math himself,
        Archimedes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Archimedes is one of a kind. Loved by the people of Syracuse. There are very few who can match his intelligence and his
        dedication. Archimedes was born in Syracuse, Sicily, within the region known as Magna Graecia, many years before me. He
        is the son of Phidias, an astronomer, and close friend to the king of our city, King Hieron II, whom he serves by
        solving problems and building inventions. Many years before I was born, I was told that Archimedes journeyed to Egypt to
        study at the Great Library of Alexandria until he completed his studies at the age of 18. I dream that I can go there
        one day and see what knowledge there is available to me.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>However, that is another dream that I must wait for. For now, I can't wait to start my tutelage under him. His teachings
        carve pathways for us to venture towards the future. The fact that I can learn from him is nothing short of a blessing.
        Math, science, building, and so much more are to be learned from him. The fact that he can find the most astounding
        discoveries from a few shapes is exhilarating.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That is one of the things that I most do love about Archimedes and will focus studying on. While I love the inventions
        that are crafted by his beautiful mind, the field of mathematics and his love for it makes me love it just as much. I do
        not understand why, but there is something hidden within the shapes and numbers, and I believe that Archimedes can teach
        it to the rest of the world. Let my lessons start today and let me become a student of knowledge as well.</p>
